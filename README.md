# About the process
It took a dark and long time to understand how data from a complete stranger domain is extracted and could be manipulated. What is relevant? What can be done? What are the key metrics? What did others analysts do?
Based on that unknown realm, the main goal of the analysis is to be a exploratory analysis. I tried to discover some relevant information about the trending videos: the lifecycle, big numbers distribution, when to post and what is the lenght distribuion of a video title. There is a huge backlog of things to explore, and I hope that in a near future i can look again at this dataset.
